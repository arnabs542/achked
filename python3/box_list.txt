Identify where potential race conditions can happen in this hardware & database configuration:

1) validate that folder Z already exists in cache or in the db
2) invalidate cache data for Z
3) INSERT file 'c' into folder Z
4) gather folder Z + children
5) update cache with new information about folder Z

hardware set-up would be as follows:

                         --- cache machine 1
                      // --------------------------- \\
outside world -- --- cache machine 2 --- database
                      \\ --------------------------- //
                         --- cache machine 3

While any machine might be asked about files within folder Z, the
actual data of folder Z will be cached on exactly 1 machine out of any
of the machines that have cache data.
